# pyapu
pyapu is a Python library designed to extract clean, structured, and reliable data from PDFs, Excel files, images, and other document formats. It leverages multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) — such as OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, local models, and custom endpoints — to turn unstructured content into consistent JSON outputs.
